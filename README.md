## Introduction

Pathfinding algorithms are fundamental in computer science and find applications in various domains, from video games to network routing. Understanding how these algorithms work can be complex, but visualizing them can make the learning process more intuitive and enjoyable.

RouteViz simplifies this learning experience by providing visual representations of pathfinding algorithms in action. Users can interact with the visualizations, gain insights into algorithm behaviors, and even experiment with custom scenarios.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall in action with interactive, real-time visualizations.
- **Custom Scenarios:** Create your own maps, set start and end points, and run the algorithms on custom scenarios to experiment with different situations.
- **Step-by-Step Control:** Step through the algorithm's execution to observe how it evaluates and selects paths.
- **Educational Tool:** RouteViz is a valuable resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding and teaching pathfinding algorithms.

## Installation

To run RouteViz on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NebulaTris/RouteViz.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd RouteViz
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries. You can use `pip` to install them from the provided `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the RouteViz application.

- On Windows, run 
```bash
   python run.pyw
```
- On Linux, run
```bash
   python3 run.pyw
```

2. Use the interactive GUI to select an algorithm, create a map, set start and end points, and visualize the algorithm in action.

3. Step through the algorithm's execution to gain a better understanding of its decision-making process.

4. Experiment with custom scenarios to see how the algorithms behave under different conditions.
